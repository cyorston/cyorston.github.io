## Projects
CFB 5B Power Rankings
- Predicts college football matchups compared to Vegas odds using play by play data for supervised ensemble ML regression modeling and Lasso/Ridge regularization. Interactive dashboard outputs point spreads for any hypothetical matchup, and achieved a 65% success rate against the Vegas model for the 2024-2025 season.

Trendiment
 - Utilized API calls for collecting technical articles to fine-tune BERT LLM models that generate sentiment analysis distributions for stocks of interest. Outputs are visualized via Power BI dashboard for on-demand interactive analysis capabilities.

## Upcoming Projects: 

BayesBall Assistant
 - Developed a Bayesian hierarchical model to predict season long fantasy baseball rankings. Integrates traditional and advanced metrics to calculate fantasy points, and PyMC3 for model building and uncertainty quantification. Automated data collection and visualized predictions in Power BI for interactive player comparisons and rankings.
